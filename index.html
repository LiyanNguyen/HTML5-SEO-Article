			<h2>HTML Elements Semantic Tags, Attributes and Values</h2>
			<p>HTML is the markup that makes the website, in simplier terms, it is like the skeleton in which the website is built upon. It consists of elements which are defined by tags, these tags tells search engines the context of your website. The content (value) inside those tags and the attributes of those tags are taken into account by search engines.</p>
			<p>By using the correct semantic tags, we can tell search engines so much more information about our website. Utilizing the correct HTML semantic tags with correct and relevant values and attributes makes websites rank higher in search engines, as it becomes more relevant to what the user is searching for.</p>
			<h3>Some Examples of HTML Semantic Tags</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;menu&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Semantic tags are important because it clearly describes what certain elements of a web page is about, these can be understood by search engines and web developers alike. For a full list of HTML5 semantic tags, refer to this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">documentation</a></p>
			<p>Another important factor is the attributes and values of these tags. The value of these tags is subjective to what the web page is about in the first place. The values are basically the content of a website such as: the written text, the images, the links, the paragraphs, the titles, etc...</p>
			<p>The attributes of the tags gives more information about the said tag. An example of this is an image. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag can have the attribute <code>alt</code> which is an attribute that describes what the image is about. This is important for SEO, as it can be understood by search engines.</p>
			<b>For example:</b>
			<p>let's say we have a website for ABC Farm in Columbia and we have an image of Orange in the web page. Ideally, we want that image to have an <code>alt</code> attribute that looks something like this: <code>alt="freshly picked orange from ABC farm in Columbia"</code>. This is a very meaningful and a good description of the image as it also makes the selling point of it came from ABC farm in Columbia. This detail will be taken into account by search engines.</p>
